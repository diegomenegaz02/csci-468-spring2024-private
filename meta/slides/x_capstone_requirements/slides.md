## Capstone Requirements

::left::
* This class is considered a capstone class in the computer science department
* As such, there are certain requirements associated with the class
* Today we will go through the requirements and explain how you can satisfy them

::right::

## Capstone Requirements

::left::
* NOTE: This has nothing to do with your grade in this class, which is based entirely on the test suite and your quiz scores

## Capstone Requirements

::left::
_Beginning in Spring Semester, 2009, all undergraduate Computer Science majors enrolled in CSCI 468 and in CSCI 483 are required, as part of the CSCI 481 requirement, to submit a portfolio of their work to the department office by the first day of finals week_

## Capstone Requirements

::left::
_One portfolio must be submitted by each CSCI 468 or CSCI 483 team. If you take both courses then your team must submit portfolios for both courses. The portfolio must contain a cover page and the seven sections described below._

## Capstone Requirements

::left::
_The cover page should have course name and number, semester taught, and team member names, listed alphabetically_

## Capstone Requirements

::left::
* Since our “teams” will consist of assisting one another with tests, everyone will submit their own paper, and mention the person that they worked with as a “tester”

::right::

## Section 1: Program

::left::
* This one is easy, just attach the entire code base as a zip file
  * Your code
  * The tests (specification)

::right::

## Section 2: Teamwork

::left::
* Here is where things are a bit tricky, since 468 is largely individual
* What we are going to do is as follows:
  * Find a partner
  * You and your partner will exchange two items
    * 3 additional tests written for the other persons parser
    * Catscript documentation

::right::

## Section 2: Teamwork

::left::
* Tests
  * Write three tests in PartnerTests.java for your partner
  * Try to make them interesting, exercising a few (up to 3) Catscript features
  * Comment them well
  * Create a patch and email them to your partner
    * Demo

::right::

## Section 2: Teamwork

::left::
* Documentation
  * See /capstone/Catscript.md
  * Fill this in with a description of the Catscript programming language
  * Be as complete as you can, and include the grammar
  * Again, create a patch for your partner
  * You will submit you partners documentation, so make sure it is good

## Section 3: Design Pattern

::left::
* Please use the Memoization Pattern to memoize calls to:

CatscriptType#getListType()

* https://java2blog.com/memoization-example-java/
  * Demo

## Section 4: Technical Writing

::left::
* Include the technical documentation generated by your partner

::right::

## Section 5: UML

::left::
* No UML was needed or used in this project because the overall design was pre-determined by the professor so we could focus on parsing

::right::

## Section 6: Design Trade-offs

::left::
* I would recommend discussing the contrast between recursive descent and parser generator
  * We chose recursive descent because it is fast enough and expresses the natural recursive nature of grammars more obviously
* There are likely other places you can discuss how you decided to implement features

::right::

## Section 7: Software life-cycle

::left::
* We used Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* You can discuss if you felt it was a good model or not for this particular project

::right::

## Partners

::left::
* OK, let's find partners for everyone
  * Don't stress about it: if necessary we can set up a three-way exchange between people
  * Your partners performance will have no bearing on your grade in the class
